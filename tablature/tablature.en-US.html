    <p class="h1">Accordion Diatonic Tablature</p>
    <p>Diatonic accordion tablature represents a valuable and accessible tool for musical initiation, especially for those without
        traditional training in sheet music reading. Before addressing the specifics and benefits of tablature for this peculiar instrument,
        it's important to understand what it means and how it differs from conventional music notation.</p>
    <p class="h2">What is Tablature?</p>
    <p>Tablature is an alternative form of music notation intended to simplify the learning of an instrument. Unlike traditional sheet
        music, which requires knowledge of music notation to interpret notes and rhythms, tablature provides direct indications on how to
        play the instrument. In the context of the diatonic accordion, this involves indicating which button to press and, in some cases,
        whether the bellows should be open or closed.</p>
    <p class="h2">Specificity of the Diatonic Accordion</p>
    <p>The diatonic accordion differs from other instruments, such as the piano, due to its unique organization of notes. While the piano
        presents a linear sequence of notes, from low to high, the diatonic accordion organizes the notes in a less intuitive way for
        beginners. This characteristic makes tablature particularly useful for this instrument, as it can guide the learner on which button
        to press without the need to understand the complex arrangement of notes on the instrument.</p>
    <p class="h2">Limitations of Tablature</p>
    <p>Despite its advantages in facilitating initial learning, tablature for the diatonic accordion has limitations. One of the main ones
        is the absence of indication about the duration of the notes. While traditional sheet music provides a complete understanding of the
        musical piece, including rhythm and dynamics, tablature mainly focuses on the location of the notes. This means that musical
        interpretation and expressiveness can be compromised if the musician relies exclusively on tablature.</p>
    <p>Another aspect is that tablature is generated, particularly, for each instrument. For example, suppose there is a "G" note in a given
        score. The tablature will indicate exactly which button should be pressed on this instrument, let's say, the fifth button of the
        inner row. If we change instruments, it may be that the same "G" note is present in a completely different position or it may not
        even exist on this new instrument.</p>
    <p class="h2">Diversity and Challenges of Tablature Models</p>
    <p>Tablature stands out for its simplified language, a less formal alternative to the conventional notation found in sheet music. This
        simplicity allows tablature models to take on varied forms, reflecting the flexibility and adaptability of this notation system.
        Although this variety brings the advantage of decentralizing the representative process, making tablatures potentially more
        accessible to different learning styles, it can also introduce significant challenges. The diversity of formats, while reflecting
        the customization of learning, can complicate the exchange of information between musicians. Each variation of tablature, being
        unique to the instrument or to the individual preference of the musician, may not be immediately understandable to others, requiring
        a period of adaptation or even the search for a common denominator in terms of graphical representation and symbols used.</p>
    <p class="h2">Importance of Standardization</p>
    <p>Standardizing basic elements in tablatures can be an effective solution to facilitate communication and exchange of musical pieces
        between musicians from different schools. The creation of a set of guidelines or universal symbols that allow clear representation
        of specific actions, such as the direction of the bellows in the diatonic accordion, button and row numbering, as well as the way to
        represent bass buttons, among others, is proposed. This approach would maintain the accessible and uncomplicated nature of
        tablatures, while providing a common basis to significantly improve the exchange of musical information. It is important to note
        that this standardization would not eliminate customization and flexibility, characteristics that make tablatures especially
        attractive to musicians.</p>

    <p class="h2">Tablature Formats Used</p>

    <section class="s3">
        <p class="h3">Note about the bass:</p>
        <p class="p3">In our project, for any tablature format, the bass will always be represented by the
            <a href="#cifras">"Chord Notation System"</a>. We understand that when dealing with diatonic accordions,
            we are talking about a very limited number of buttons in the bass section (usually 8 or 12), making
            them easy to memorize. Some tablature systems number both the melody lines
            (right hand) and the bass lines (left hand).
        </p>
        <p class="p3">Another peculiarity of the bass buttons is that they can represent individual notes or
            chords (which can be major or minor). For these representations, we have adopted the following patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="p3">Bass note: Uppercase letter - e.g., Note “A”, letter “A”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="p3">Major chord: Lowercase letter - e.g., Major chord “A”, letter “a”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="p3">Minor chord: Lowercase letter and hyphen - e.g., Minor chord "A minor”, letter “a-”</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <p>In our "Map for Diatonic Accordions", we have chosen 3 different formats to offer some different options to those learning the
        instrument and, at the same time, not create too many differentiations. These are:</p>
    <section class="s1">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>German Format</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cyclical Numeric Format</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Continuous Numeric Format</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <p>Note: For each of them, there may be variations, as we will explain below.</p>
    <p class="h2">German Format</p>

    <p>This format is called "German Format" because it has been derived from the teachings of Yann Dour, in his book "Schule für
        Diatonisches Akkordion – Band 1". Essentially, the buttons in each row are numbered, from top to bottom, that is, from the chin
        towards the knees, from 1 to "n", where "n" represents the last button of the row. Apostrophes "'" are used to differentiate the
        rows, where the first row (the outermost one) does not have any apostrophe; the second row has one character; the third row has two
        characters "''" and so on, adding an extra apostrophe to each new row.</p>

    <p>Consider the key layout of a given accordion, as shown in the image below and to the left:</p>

    <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
        <div id="Image1" style="width: 40%; display: inline-flex; float: left;">
            <img style="margin-left:3em; height:16cm;" alt="" src="fig01.png" />
        </div>
        <div style="display: inline-flex; width: 60%;">
            <p style="margin-left: 1em; margin-top:0">Using the tablature format description from the paragraph above and considering only
                the melody buttons (right hand), the numbering would be as follows:</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Image2" style="display: inline-flex; float:right; width: 60%; padding:0; position:relative;">
            <img style="margin-left:3em; height:14cm;" alt="" src="fig02.png" />
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This way of numbering the buttons is very intuitive and can be applied to any accordion. Still observing the image above, the
        nomenclature used in the bass buttons (left hand) is also noticeable, with their notes (uppercase letters), their major chords
        (lowercase letters), and, in the case, a single minor chord, A minor, represented by "a-".</p>
    <p>The melody buttons (right hand) follow the same nomenclature, with the difference that here there are only individual notes, so all
        are represented by uppercase letters.</p>
    <p>In the tablature, we will use numbers (with or without apostrophes) to represent the melody notes and letters from the "Chord
        Notation System"
        to represent the bass.</p>
    <p class="h2">Bissonority</p>
    <p>One fundamental characteristic of the diatonic accordion still remains to be mapped. Bissonority, meaning the functionality that each
        button has to emit two different sounds: opening the bellows plays one note or chord and, closing the bellows, another different
        one.</p>
    <p>In our Map, we use split circles to represent the accordion buttons. Always, the upper half of the button represents the note (or
        chord) when the bellows are closed and the lower half, the note (or chord) that sounds when opening the bellows.</p>
    <p class="h2">Finally, The Tablature: Bringing it all together</p>
    <p>Now that we have learned how to number the melody buttons and how to represent the bass, let's see how we will combine all this in
        the tablature.</p>
    <p>Accordion tablature can be well represented by a table with 3 rows:</p>
    <section class="s1">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The top row represents the bass notes (left hand).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The second and third rows display the buttons played with the right hand, where the second row
                    shows which buttons should be
                    pressed with the bellows closing and the third row shows the buttons pressed with the bellows opening.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The vertical lines represent the bar lines.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <div id="Image3" style=" position:relative; padding:0; left:3em; top:0;">
        <img style="height:2.4cm;" alt="" src="fig03.en.png" />
    </div>
    <p>Despite the simple design, many pieces of information are represented simultaneously. Note that, in the example
        above, we have the representation of two measures.</p>
    <p>In the first one, G basses are played (G and g),
        respectively, the note G and the G Major chord, while button number 6 of the
        first row (outer) is pressed, with the bellows closing.</p>
    <p>The second measure indicates the execution of D basses (D and d), respectively the note D and the D Major chord,
        also pressing, simultaneously, button number 6 of the first row (outer), with the bellows opening.</p>
    <p>On the website, a tablature similar to the example above will be displayed as follows:</p>
    <div id="Image4" style=" position:relative; padding:0; left:3em; top:0;">
        <img alt="" src="fig04.png" />
    </div>
    <p>The main difference appears in the first column on the left: we use the word <b>“Bass”</b> to identify
        the bass line (left hand) and the melody lines (right hand) are identified by the symbol <b>“TAB”</b>,
        adding the symbol <b>“&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;”</b> to identify the line when the bellows movement is closing and
        the symbol <b>“&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;”</b> to identify the line showing the bellows opening.
        Otherwise, each measure will be separated by the vertical bar and will contain as many columns as necessary.</p>

    <p class="h2">German Format – Numbered Rows</p>

    <p>So far, we have described the basic tablature model that we have adopted in this project. Let's add
        a small variation: instead of marking the rows with apostrophes, let's number them, starting from the
        outer row, which will be number 1, counting increasingly, up to n, when the inner row is reached.
        It would look like this:</p>

    <div id="Image5" style=" position:relative; padding:0; left:3em; top:0;">
        <img alt="" style="height:13cm;" src="fig05.png" />
    </div>

    <p>In this new model, the same example of the previous tablature is represented as follows:</p>

    <div id="Image6" style=" position:relative; padding:0; left:3em; top:0;">
        <img alt="" src="fig06.png" />
    </div>

    <p>Note that instead of the apostrophe, we use a numeric index to represent the row.</p>

    <p class="h2">Cyclic Numeric Format</p>

    <p>This new format, which we call Cyclic Numeric, eliminates the need to number the rows
        because they are numbered starting with a different decade each. Of course, the rows can have
        more than 10 buttons, which would cause the repetition of button numbers. This, in fact, happens, but can be
        overcome with some trickery, such as adding an additional character to differentiate the
        buttons with repeated numbers.</p>
    <p class="P17">For this new format, in addition to changes in the tablature, the keyboard layout map itself
        will be shown differently. We will have two variants, which we will call cyclic numeric format
        with notes or only numbers, like this:</p>

    <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
        <div id="Image7" style="padding:0; float:left; position:relative; width: 40%;">
            <img style="margin-left: 3em; height:14cm" alt="" src="fig07.png" />
        </div>
        <div id="Image8" style=" padding:0; float:left; position:relative;">
            <img style="height:14cm" alt="" src="fig08.png" />
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The figures above show the two variants of this format: in the left figure, the names
        of the notes remain, however, thumbnails indicating the numbering are added; in the second
        variant (on the right), the names of the notes disappear from the keyboard layout, leaving only the numbers.
    </p>
    <p>In the example above, it is also possible to see that it was necessary to disambiguate button 11, which occurs at the end
        external row, from that which starts the second row (internal). The letter "A" was used to differentiate them.
        Note that this same letter will also appear in the tablature, if the button in question is used in the music.
    </p>
    <p>The tablature, in turn, will remain like this:</p>
    <div id="Image9">
        <img style=" margin-left: 3em;" src="fig09.png" />
    </div>
    <p class="h2">Continuous Numeric Format</p>
    <p>The third (and last) format that we present was inspired by the numbering that some manufacturers use
        to differentiate the buttons.</p>
    <p>Starting from the outermost button, at the top, count from 1 to "n", with "n" being the
        last button of the innermost row. Thus, the need to use extra characters to differentiate buttons is eliminated,
        but, like the cyclic numeric format, in this format some problems can also appear
        depending on the keyboard layouts. To solve these difficulties in identifying each button, the keyboard map
        will have to be shown differently again, like this:</p>

    <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
        <div id="Image10" style="padding:0; float:left; position:relative; width: 40%;">
            <img style="margin-left: 3em; height:14cm" alt="" src="fig10.png" />
        </div>
        <div id="Image11" style=" padding:0; float:left; position:relative;">
            <img style="height:14cm" alt="" src="fig11.png" />
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This format is very similar to the previous one, but some changes are visible. Note that there is no
        duplication in button 11, however, the second row starts with number 12. Observe the
        tablature segment that (it is the same as the previous example) and notice that the note "G" is now counted as
        button 16 (before it was number 15).</p>

    <div id="Image12">
        <img style=" margin-left: 3em;" src="fig12.png" />
    </div>

    <p class="h2">Other Elements of the Tablature</p>

    <p>As seen in the tablature excerpt above, some extra elements can appear.</p>
    <p>In the first measure, for example, there are no bass sounds; only melody notes sound, represented by 2 touches on button 16.
        Note that, in the first third of the measure, there is no sound (it is a pause).
        Thus, to represent the pause, a bar, similar to a dash "–", was used.</p>
    <p>Another very common element is the sound continuity symbol. For example, in the second measure,
        the A minor chord "a-" starts with the note from button 16 and should last during the execution of this note and the next (button
        15).
        An arrow "→" is used to represent this continuity. That is, the A minor chord is played along with note 16
        and this will be maintained until the time of note 15 ends.</p>

    <p id="cifras" class="h2">Chord Notation System</p>

    <p>The "Chord Notation System" is a globally recognized convention for the notation of musical chords, used to simplify the reading and
        sharing of musical compositions among musicians from different languages and cultures. This system uses letters from the Latin
        alphabet to
        represent the chords, accompanied by numbers and symbols that indicate modifications, such as minor, augmented, diminished chords,
        and other variations.</p>
    <p>Here, in the Map, we use this convention to represent not only chords but also musical notes. As we know, the monosyllabic indicators
        of sound pitch were introduced by Guido d'Arezzo, are predominantly used in Latin-speaking countries and correspond to the seven
        letters
        (alphabetic system introduced by Pope Gregory I in the 6th century) used in English, German, Greek, etc. They are:</p>

    <table class="tabCifra">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Do</th>
                <th>Re</th>
                <th>Mi</th>
                <th>Fa</th>
                <th>Sol</th>
                <th>La</th>
                <th>Si</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>English</th>
                <td>C</td>
                <td>D</td>
                <td>E</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>G</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>B</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>German</th>
                <td>C</td>
                <td>D</td>
                <td>E</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>G</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>H</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Note: In English, the letter "B" represents the note "B"; in German, the letter "B" represents the note "B flat," and "B" is
        represented by "H." In this project, we use the English nomenclature.</p>

    <p>Numbers and symbols are used to indicate specific alterations in basic chords, such as 7 (seventh), m (minor), or # (sharp), among
        others. However, diatonic accordions with 8 or 12 bass buttons have only major and minor chords. As mentioned earlier, here we use
        uppercase letters to represent notes and lowercase letters for chords. When it comes to minor chords, we opt for the hyphen "-"
        instead of the letter "m".</p>

    <p>Keyboard layouts can be shown using both the English convention and the Latin names of the notes, like this:</p>
